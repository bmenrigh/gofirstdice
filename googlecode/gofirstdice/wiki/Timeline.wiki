A timeline of notable events in the history of the Go First Dice project.

 * Early Aug 2010. During a dinner at GenCon gaming convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, game designer James Ernest (of Cheapass Games) asks Eric Harshbarger if it would be possible to create "a set of eight six-sided dice used to see who could go first in a game such that, 1) there are never ties when the dice are rolled, and 2) each roller will always have a perfectly fair chance of rolling high (i.e. going first) regardless of which subsets of dice are singly rolled against one another." Eric immediately considers a "serpentine" arrangement of the numbers 1-48 across the dice, but doubts it will hold up.

 * 9 Aug 2010. Eric emails friend and fellow Auburn University math alumnus, Robert Ford, detailing the problem and asking if he has any insight. Robert quickly demonstrates that the serpentine numbering does _not_ work for subsets of 3 dice (it does work for 2 players).

 * 10 Aug 2010. Robert demonstrates a configuration of 3d6 that is fair for 2 or 3 players. This may have already been known; Eric had heard a 3d6 set of dice was sold commercially, but he has never seen them.

 * 11 Aug 2010. Robert points out that a 5-player solution will be impossible for the originally stated target of 8d6 since the number of players in any/every subset must evenly divide the number of outcomes. They decide to focus on other (theoretically possible) dice configurations, namely; 4d6, 4d12, 5d30, 6d30, and so forth.

 * 29 Aug 2010. Eric demonstrates (via exhaustive computer search) that the 4d6 space does not hold a solution.

 * 4 Sep 2010. Robert finds (by hand) the following 4d12 solution:
{{{
Die 1 : 1,  8,  11,  14,  19,  22,  27,  30,  35,  38,  41,  48
Die 2 : 2,  7,  10,  15,  18,  23,  26,  31,  34,  39,  42,  47
Die 3 : 3,  6,  12,  13,  17,  24,  25,  32,  36,  37,  43,  46
Die 4 : 4,  5,  9,   16,  20,  21,  28,  29,  33,  40,  44,  45 
}}}
and asks for verification from computer aids Eric has written. Robert also points out that the configuration is "place fair" (each player has equal chance of rolling 2nd highest, 3rd highest, etc). However, he mistakenly believes that his configuration is _not_ "permutation fair" (equi-probable that any ordering of results will occur).

 * 4 Sep 2010. Eric laser cuts and assembles a set of wooden 4d12 with the configuration Robert has found.

 * 13 Jan 2012. Eric begins engraving and selling sets of 4d12 Go First Dice on his website (http://www.ericharshbarger.org/dice/#gofirst_4d12). Eric also begins attacking the 5d30 case in earnest using computer searching methods.

 * 5 Feb 2012. Eric finds a 5d30 case with the following properties: four of the dice may be used as a 4d30 "permutation fair" set and if a fifth player is present, a specific fifth die may be added to the set that allows all five to be used to determine (only) go-first fairness. Here is the configuration:
{{{
Die 1: 1,9,12,20,22,26,35,39,41,50,55,60,65,67,74,77,84,86,91,96,101,110,112,116,125,129,131,139,142,150
Die 2: 2,8,15,19,23,28,31,36,44,46,54,59,64,70,72,79,81,87,92,97,105,107,115,120,123,128,132,136,143,149

}}}

 * 16 Feb 2012. Eric demonstrates the following set of differing-sided dice and the fact that they are go-first (but no stronger) fair if N players are restricted to choosing only from the N-smallest sized dice:
{{{
d2: 5,5
d4: 6,6,4,4
d6: 7,7,3,3,3,3
d8: 8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2
d10: 9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
d12: 10,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 
}}}
It is clear that the above set can easily be extended to handle any number of players.

 * mid-Mar 2012. Eric points out to Robert that the original 4d12 configuration they have been using on the engraved dice _is, in fact_, permutation fair; Robert rechecks his calculations and finds his mistake.

 * 29 Mar 2012. Eric speaks about the 4d12 Go First Dice at the tenth "Gathering for Gardner" (G4G10). He meets Carl Hoff at this conference.

 * 16 April 2012. Carl introduces the problem to Brandon Enright and Landon Kryger.

 * 27 April 2012. Brandon finds there are 128 4d12 sets that are column-grouped.

 * 27 April 2012. Brandon finds several thousand place-fair 5d30 sets. One example:
{{{
Die 1: 0,9,13,15,22,29,31,39,43,46,53,55,61,65,72,75,84,89,92,96,102,107,114,118,121,128,130,136,142,148

 * 27 April 2012. Brandon finds some permutation-fair 4d18 sets. One example:
{{{

}}}
There are 3828 column-grouped perm-fair 4d18 sets.  3812 (all but 16) have a special symmetry Brandon calls "modulus table mirroring".

 * 29 April 2012. Brandon proves (by exhaustive computer search) there are no 5d30 column-grouped mirrored solutions.

 * Early May 2012. Landon finds all 3374 (2356 if you don't count a mirror of a solution) 4d12 solutions.

 * 18 Sep 2012. Alex Bellos (blogger for the UK Guardian) writes an article about the Go First Dice. He had met Eric at G4G10. The article brings much more attention to the dice sets.

 * 2 Oct 2012. Byron Knoll posts on his blog (http://byronknoll.blogspot.com/2012/10/five-player-go-first-dice.html) that a friend of his, Paul Vanetti, has demonstrated a set of 5 dice that are permutation-fair. The dice are different sizes, but Paul further argues that any incongruent dice may all be made equi-faceted if the number of faces is increased to the least common multiple (LCM) of the original dice. The demonstrated 5-set is here (0-indexed):

The LCM of the above dice is 1440. Also, Paul states to Byron that his construction method may be used to induce any order set (i.e. any number of players) N, assuming that a valid N-1 order set is already known.

 * 4 Oct 2012. Before direct contact with Paul Vanetti is made, Robert Ford "reverse engineers" Paul's method (or, at least, concocts a method that is able to generate Paul's exhibited 5-set). Ford explains it to Eric via telephone that evening.

 * 5 Oct 2012. Eric applies a slightly altered construction method (when inducing from 3 player to 4 player sets he works with only two copies of the 3 player set instead of three). This yields this permutation-fair set of 5 dice:
{{{

This also has an LCM of 1440, but the number of total faces amongst all dice is reduced from 266 to 210 (not really a big deal, but it does illustrate Paul's method might be tweaked in valuable ways).

 * 5 Oct 2012. Eric applies Paul's construction method to _the original 4d12 set_ and this yields a 5 dice set that has an LCM of 720 (an improvement):

 * 24 Feb 2013. Eric notices an interesting, if not terribly useful, fact. The numbers that crop up during the inductive constructive method seem to correlate to the "Cotesian numbers" ([http://oeis.org/A100642]). Other than their appearance in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, though, their seems to be nothing written about these numbers outside of a couple old academic journals. The negative numbers that crop up in this sequence cast some doubt on whether Paul's inductive construction method will work indefinitely.

 * 29 Mar 2013. After a long day of mathematical wrangling, Eric finds a perm-fair 20-36-36-60-180 set:

These faces have an lcm of 180, so a 5d180 set is now known. This is the smallest equal-sided 5-set found so far (improving from the 5d360 result earlier).

Using similar techniques, it is also possible to create a 20-24-36-48-72 perm-fair set. This has a higher lcm (360), but the largest die is a d72, better than the d90 min-max from before. It also uses a total of only 200 faces among all dice, besting the 210 record from earlier.
